# Phase 3 — Create the brain/ structure

Create the root files + the single `brain/` folder + protocol files. Apply Phase 2 merge decisions during template population.

## 3a. Create folders and the plugin-version marker

```bash
mkdir -p brain/docs/detail brain/preview brain/chapters
```

### Write `brain/chapters/README.md`

```markdown
# brain/chapters/ — Delegated-Work Units

One file per chapter, named `NN-name.md` (e.g. `01-auth.md`).

## Lifecycle

1. **CEO** opens a new file, fills in `## Goal` and `## Plan`, then hands it off.  
   (Use the `ceo` skill — it scaffolds the file and delegates to a worktree.)
2. **Worker** executes the work on a branch, then appends `## Completion Report`.  
   (Use the `worker` skill — it defines the exact report format.)
3. **CEO** reads the report and fills in `## CEO Verdict` (approved → merge, or returned → reason).

## Template

Copy `_TEMPLATE.md` when creating a new chapter.
```

### Write `brain/chapters/_TEMPLATE.md`

```markdown
# Chapter NN — <name>

## Goal
<CEO: what this chapter delivers>

**Method:** solo | CEO+worker | CEO+specialists

## Plan
<CEO: approach; how it splits across workers if multi-specialist>

---
<!-- Completion Reports append below — one per worker pass (e.g. backend, then UI, then wire-up). Never overwrite a prior report. -->

<!-- CEO Verdicts append below, one per report verified. -->
```

The canonical **Completion Report** format (workers append one per pass):

```markdown
## Completion Report — YYYY-MM-DD · <author stamp>
**Goal:** … / **Status:** done|partial|blocked / **Changed:** … / **Verified:** … / **Flags:** … / **Commit:** branch · hash
```

The canonical **Verdict** format (CEO appends one per report verified):

```markdown
## Verdict — YYYY-MM-DD · CEO (<author stamp>)
**Decision:** approved | changes requested / **Notes:** …
```

### Write `brain/.plugin-version` marker

Write the current plugin version (read from the plugin manifest) to this one-line file. The `SessionStart` drift-detector hook compares it against the installed plugin version to detect drift.

```bash
# Resolve plugin version from the manifest, then stamp it.
echo "<current-plugin-version>" > brain/.plugin-version
```

On re-init / audit: overwrite with the current version after standards are re-applied.

> There is no `.session-type` marker. The old three-folder layout used it to pick a WORKLOG path. With a single `brain/` folder there is only one WORKLOG (`brain/WORKLOG.md`). Authorship is captured by the **author-stamp** on each entry, not by a marker file.

### Author-stamp at write time

When writing any WORKLOG / BRIEF / CHANGELOG entry, stamp it with the current author detected from the runtime:

- `· Cowork` when running inside a Cowork session.
- `· Codex` when `CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set.
- `· Claude Code` when running as Claude Code.

A reasonable detection (used only to choose the stamp string — nothing is persisted):

```bash
if [ -n "${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" ]; then
  AUTHOR="Codex"
elif [ -n "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" ]; then
  AUTHOR="Claude Code"
else
  AUTHOR="Cowork"
fi
```

## 3b. Root files

### Root `CLAUDE.md` template

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md — [Project Name]

> Always loaded by every agent. This is the front page / rules index — NOT the brain. The brain is the `brain/` folder; this file points into it. Read top to bottom every session.

## Coding Standards

**1. Think Before Coding** — State assumptions. Surface tradeoffs. Ask when unclear.
**2. Simplicity First** — Minimum code. No speculative features. No unnecessary abstractions.
**3. Surgical Changes** — Touch only what you must. Match existing style.
**4. Verify Before Closing** — Define done before touching code. Screenshot UI changes. Reproduce bugs before fixing.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Decide before you act. Write it down before you decide.
2. When you change one file, list every other file that becomes stale (see `README.md` cascade rules).
3. Lock-before-cascade: changes hit `brain/BRIEF.md` first, then propagate. Rejected options go in `brain/WONT-DO.md`.
4. Audit before close: independent verification before any chapter is marked done.
5. Commit + push before leaving any chat. Pull main before starting one.
6. One tool active at a time.
7. **If Node project:** read `brain/TOOLING.md` before any package, install, or dev-server work. Never run the wrong package manager — check TOOLING.md for this project's choice.
8. **UI work uses the design system. No hardcoded values, ever.** Before editing any `.tsx` / `.jsx` / `.vue` / `.svelte` / `.swift` / styles file: read `brain/DESIGN.md` for tokens and `brain/FUNDAMENTALS.md` for the Token Rule. Run the `design-check` skill before writing and again after. Raw hex, raw px, raw `font-family` strings, emoji-as-icon, and other cardinal sins from `FUNDAMENTALS.md` in component files are violations — not preferences. If a needed token doesn't exist in `DESIGN.md`: stop and propose adding it. Do not improvise.
9. **UI components — shadcn first when shadcn is in `package.json`.** Default: always use the shadcn primitive (`<Button>`, `<Input>`, `<Select>`, `<Dialog>`, `<Popover>`, `<Tooltip>`, `<Sheet>`, `<Drawer>`, `<Tabs>`, `<Accordion>`, `<DropdownMenu>`, `<Command>`, `<Toast>`, `<Alert>`, `<Checkbox>`, `<Radio>`, `<Switch>`, `<Slider>`, `<Textarea>`). Never silently fall back to the native element because it's faster to type. Allowed native elements: `<a href>` for navigation, `<button type="submit">` inside a `<form>` when no styled `<Button>` is needed, `<input type="hidden">`. If a needed primitive doesn't exist in shadcn (e.g. date-range picker), stop and ask: build one in `components/ui/` following shadcn conventions, install a community block, or use another library.
10. Use the skill index below. Don't improvise a workflow when a skill exists for it.
11. **Won't-do:** when any idea or option is rejected, append one author-stamped line to `brain/WONT-DO.md` (format: `YYYY-MM-DD · [stamp] — what — why`). Read `brain/WONT-DO.md` before proposing new ideas so nothing is re-litigated.
12. **Change-tracking:** note every change as it happens — one author-stamped WORKLOG line or Completion Report entry per action. No version numbers. Never reconstruct the log at the end of a session.
13. **Research, don't reflect.** When the user asks for an opinion, a recommendation, or expert input, you must (a) research current facts first — search, don't answer from memory — and (b) give an independent, reasoned view with trade-offs and at least one risk they didn't raise. Never end by simply restating the user's own input as the answer. For non-trivial decisions, invoke the `advisor` skill. Present findings in whatever form helps most — table, diagram, chart, HTML, form, artifact — using any available tool.

## Git rules

**Commit format:** `type(scope): summary [ch-NN] · Agent` — Agent is `· Cowork`, `· Codex`, or `· Claude Code`.

**Branches:** CEO works on `main` / the canon branch. Worker branches are named `ch-NN-name` (e.g. `ch-03-auth`).

**Worktree sync is local:** to bring canon into a worktree, run `git merge main` inside the worktree — never push-then-pull through GitHub. GitHub is a backup, not the sync mechanism.

**Push policy:** push at session close (end of chat) or as a manual backup anytime. The CEO↔worker loop does not require a push.

**Write boundary:** workers edit code files and their own chapter file only. The CEO owns the shared canon: `brain/STATUS.md`, `brain/BRIEF.md`, `brain/ROADMAP.md`, `brain/WONT-DO.md`.

**Cowork:** can commit locally but cannot push — it emits the push command for the human to run.

Full per-tool procedures + Cowork git setup: see the `git` skill.

## Skill index — what's available and when to use it

| Skill | When to use it | How to invoke |
|---|---|---|
| `ceo` | Orchestrate a chapter: define goal/plan, delegate to a worktree, verify the worker's report, merge on approval. | `/ceo` · "start a chapter", "define chapter", "delegate work" |
| `worker` | Execute one chapter in a worktree, write the Completion Report, commit on its branch. | `/worker` · "work on chapter", "execute chapter" |

| `session-recap` | Mid-session snapshot — reads WORKLOG + STATUS and reports current state. | `/session-recap` · "recap", "where are we", "what have we done", "catch me up" |
| `advisor` | Expert research + recommendation — researches before opining, forms an independent view, never just reflects. | model-invoked |
| `verify-by-reading` | Read-before-answer enforcement — opens actual files before answering questions about content. | `/verify-by-reading` · "what does X say", "is Y implemented", before answering any file-content question |

## Hooks index — what runs automatically

| Hook event | What it does | What to do when it warns |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Injects orient reminder: read CLAUDE.md + brain/STATUS.md before touching code, run save-session before closing. | Follow it. Read CLAUDE.md and brain/STATUS.md now if you haven't. |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Reminds to classify the task (NEW / ADDITION / UI CHANGE / BUG FIX) and append to brain/WORKLOG.md after each action. | Classify before acting. Append a WORKLOG entry (author-stamped) after each change. |
| `PreToolUse Edit\|Write` | Checks if brain/WORKLOG.md is in cleared state; warns if so (means no entry logged yet this session). | Append a WORKLOG entry for the change you're about to make. |
| `PreCompact` | Backs up brain/WORKLOG.md before compaction so content survives context trim. | No action needed — informational. Content is preserved in backup. |
| `PostCompact` | Re-injects orient reminder after compaction. | Re-read CLAUDE.md and brain/STATUS.md to re-orient before continuing. |
| `SubagentStart` | Appends a `subagent_start` timestamp to brain/WORKLOG.md. | No action needed — automatic bookkeeping. |
| `SubagentStop` | Appends a `subagent_stop` timestamp to brain/WORKLOG.md. | No action needed — automatic bookkeeping. |
| `Stop` | Checks brain/WORKLOG.md for unsaved work; warns with line count if save-session hasn't run. | Run `/save-session` before closing the chat. |
| `PostToolUse Edit\|Write` (design-scan) | After any UI file write, greps content for raw hex, raw px, raw font-family, native elements when shadcn exists, banned patterns. | Fix each flagged violation before continuing. Violations are not preferences. |
| `PostToolUse Edit\|Write` (design-check dispatcher) | After writing to a component-tier path, instructs agent to run `/design-check` on the file. | Run `/design-check` on the written file immediately. |
| `SessionStart` (drift-detector) | Detects plugin-version drift by comparing `brain/.plugin-version` to current plugin version. | Run `/migrate-project` when prompted to apply pending deltas. |

## Situation router — common requests → which skill

See `brain/SITUATIONS.md` for the full routing table.

## Folder map

- `brain/` — the single canon folder. Every agent reads here. Every protocol file (STATUS, BRIEF, ROADMAP, WORKLOG, CHANGELOG, agenda, design system, docs) lives here, once.
- `brain/chapters/` — one file per unit of delegated work (CEO goal + worker report + verdict).

## Pre-task classification (mandatory before any code change)

1. NEW standalone feature
2. ADDITION to existing feature
3. UI CHANGE
4. BUG FIX

Check `brain/docs/INDEX.md` dependency entries before classifying.

# README.md — File Map & Dependencies

> Open this whenever you're about to change a non-trivial file. Find that file below. Its "When this changes" line tells you which other files need updating.

## File catalog

### Root
- **CLAUDE.md** — always-loaded front page / rules index. Points into `brain/`.
- **README.md** — this file. Open before any non-trivial edit.

### `brain/`
- **.plugin-version** — plugin-version marker. Read by the drift-detector hook; bumped by migrate-project / modernize.
- **STATUS.md** — current project state. No cascade.
- **BRIEF.md** — project decisions (WHAT we build). Author-stamped per version block. When this changes: `brain/ROADMAP.md` may need updating, `brain/STATUS.md` Next Actions may need updating, `brain/agenda.md` may need re-derivation.
- **WONT-DO.md** — running list of rejected decisions, each with a one-line reason. No cascade.
- **ROADMAP.md** — phases and ordering. When this changes: `brain/STATUS.md` Next Actions update, `brain/agenda.md` re-derive.
- **WORKLOG.md** — real-time, author-stamped per entry. Cleared by save-session.
- **CHANGELOG.md** — project history, author-stamped. Never cleared.
- **agenda.md** — daily steering file. When `brain/ROADMAP.md` or `brain/BRIEF.md` change: re-derive.
- **BRAND.md** — product identity. When this changes: `brain/DESIGN.md` may need updating.
- **FUNDAMENTALS.md** — global design framework. Never edited per project.
- **TOOLING.md** — Node tooling convention for this project (package manager, lockfile, Node version). When this changes: refreshed from plugin template with chosen package manager, not by hand.
- **DESIGN.md** — project tokens. When this changes: pending UI work pauses until tokens validate.
- **STRUCTURE.md** — codebase surface map. When this changes: build-component / design-check read the new surfaces.
- **DISCOVERIES.md** — append-only UI patterns. No cascade.
- **SITUATIONS.md** — situation router (linked from root CLAUDE.md).
- **docs/INDEX.md** — feature dependency map. Source for cross-feature lookups.
- **docs/detail/** — deep reference. When changed: relevant feature contracts may need re-reading.
- **preview/** — design-direction preview HTML files. Gitignored. Garbage-collected by `audit` (keeps most recent 2 per direction-slug).
- **marketing/** — marketing-brief output (CONTENT registry, sitemap, per-page briefs/copy, media manifest). Consumed by build-page.
- **chapters/** — one file per unit of delegated work (CEO goal + worker report + verdict).

## Cascade summary (rule of thumb)

```
brain/BRIEF.md → brain/ROADMAP.md → brain/STATUS.md → brain/agenda.md
```

If you change anything upstream, check everything downstream.

## 3d. Design-system & docs files

- `brain/BRAND.md`, `brain/FUNDAMENTALS.md`, `brain/DESIGN.md`, `brain/DISCOVERIES.md` — created in Phase 4 (see `phase-4-design-system.md`).
- `brain/STRUCTURE.md` — created on first `build-component` run, OR during Phase 0c modernize, OR during Phase 4 if the user opts in.
- `brain/TOOLING.md` — Node projects only; rendered in Phase 4a.
- `brain/docs/INDEX.md` and `brain/docs/detail/README.md` — created in Phase 5.

## 3e. Apply Phase 2 merge decisions

For every file in the Phase 2 decision table:
- **Merge** → write the extracted content into the destination protocol file
- **Brain docs** → move into `brain/docs/` and buffer the cross-references for Phase 5
- **Reference** → add one line to root CLAUDE.md `## Reference files`
- **Leave** / **Skip** → no action

## 3f. Verify

```bash
ls -la
ls brain/
ls brain/docs/
```

Confirm the single `brain/` folder exists with expected files. Specifically check:
- `CLAUDE.md` — root (always-loaded front page / rules index)
- `README.md` — root (file catalog + cascade rules)
- `brain/.plugin-version` — version marker present
- `brain/SITUATIONS.md` — situation router (linked from root CLAUDE.md)
- `brain/WONT-DO.md` — rejected-decisions log present
- `brain/TOOLING.md` — if Node project (package manager filled in from Phase 4a ask-at-init)
