## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-22

Minor release. `design-direction` now generates concrete tokens (colours, typography, spacing) and ships a self-contained HTML preview the user opens in their browser to visually approve before any write. Closes the v2.0.x gap where the skill produced rich brand prose but never updated the actual design tokens — projects ran `design-direction`, got beautiful BRAND.md updates, and looked identical afterwards because `DESIGN.md`'s token frontmatter stayed at defaults.

### Added

- **`design-direction` Phase 6.5 — token alignment + visual preview.** New phase inserted between Phase 6 (pick direction) and Phase 7 (write outputs). Reads existing `agents/DESIGN.md` token frontmatter, classifies MATCH / partial-MISMATCH / full-MISMATCH per category, generates concrete hex / font / spacing / radius values for mismatched categories using the locked direction's material reference + temperature + saturation, runs WCAG AA contrast validation on 8 load-bearing pairs (refuses to write a palette that fails), renders a self-contained HTML preview page, surfaces a `file://` link the user opens in their browser, then asks for approve / iterate / reject. Iteration loop translates plain-language corrections ("too orange", "display feels heavy", "dark mode is muddy") into token-level changes and re-previews. Soft 5-iteration limit triggers a step-back-to-Phase-6 meta-prompt. Files: `skills/design-direction/references/phase-6-5-token-alignment.md` (token logic), `skills/design-direction/references/phase-6-5-preview-html.md` (preview HTML spec + template + font-loading rules + iteration semantics).

- **HTML preview page** — written to `agents/preview/<direction-slug>-<date>.html` on every Phase 6.5 run with token changes. Single self-contained file, no build step, ~400 lines including inline CSS. Loads Google Fonts via `<link>` when fonts are available; falls back to nearest Google cousin for Pangram / commercial fonts and notes the substitution in the footer. Renders 21 sections: top bar with light/dark toggle, surface swatches (paper/ash/ink/hairline), accent swatches, status swatches, WCAG contrast pairs panel with PASS/FAIL badges, display ramp (72/56/40/28 px), body ramp (18/16/14 px), mono code sample, letter-spacing test, spacing scale visualization (bars at 4/8/12/16/24/32/48/64), radius squares, all 12 components from DESIGN.md's component list (buttons / form / card / dialog / table / tabs / badges / toast) styled with the proposed tokens, and a real-content hero section that surfaces typography pairing fights. Display headlines and body paragraphs are brand-fitting prose drawn from the locked archetype, not lorem ipsum.

- **Archetype → palette + typography heuristic tables in Phase 6.5.** Two 12-row tables in `phase-6-5-token-alignment.md`: (1) archetype → paper temperature, ink temperature, accent character, OKLCH chroma ceiling (Sage 0.12, Magician 0.18, Caregiver 0.10, Rebel 0.25, Creator 0.20, Hero 0.18, Explorer 0.14, Innocent 0.10, Lover 0.12, Jester 0.22, Ruler 0.16, Everyman 0.14); (2) archetype → display / body / mono font picks, biased toward Google Fonts (Source Serif 4, Fraunces, Inter, Geist, JetBrains Mono, Recursive) with commercial fonts (Tiempos, Lyon, Recoleta) flagged with cost notes for the user to opt into.

- **Surface tier detection (new Phase 6.5 step 1).** Classifies project as `dashboard` / `marketing` / `both` from `agents/BRAND.md` Product.Surfaces field. Drives type scale ratio (dashboard 1.125, marketing 1.25, editorial 1.333), display-font banning strictness (strict on marketing, relaxed on dashboard-only), and whether to generate a categorical chart palette.

- **Cultural anchor + script detection (new Phase 6.5 step 2).** Detects Indic / Arabic / Hebrew brand context from `agents/BRAND.md` Cultural anchor field. Pairs Latin body font with the matching script font (Devanagari / Gujarati / Gurmukhi → Mukta or Hind; Tamil → Noto Sans Tamil; Bengali → Noto Sans Bengali; Arabic → Noto Sans Arabic). Skill refuses to ship a Latin-only stack for an Indic-market brand.

- **WCAG contrast validation gate.** New Phase 6.5 substep computes WCAG ratios for 8 load-bearing pairs (ink/paper in both modes, ink/ash in both modes, paper-on-accent for CTAs, accent-on-paper for links, hairline visibility, status.error/paper) using the standard relative-luminance formula. Hard rule: refuse to write a palette that fails AA. Auto-suggests a fix (darken ink, shift accent hue, increase chroma) and re-validates before re-previewing.

- **Dark-mode generation rules.** Explicit rules added to Phase 6.5 step 6: don't invert; desaturate accent chroma by 20–35% for dark mode; shift accent lightness up 5–10% so it doesn't recede; hairline becomes lighter than paper on dark canvas (highlights, not depressions); never `#000`, always 4–8% temperature tint.

- **Categorical chart palette generator.** When surface tier includes dashboard AND the project has data viz needs, Phase 6.5 emits an 8-stop categorical palette in OKLCH at constant L=60% (light) / L=70% (dark) and C=0.15. Hues spaced at 30 / 60 / 120 / 180 / 210 / 270 / 300 / 340 for perceptual evenness. Skipped entirely when no dashboard surface.

- **`design-direction` Phase 5 — anti-convergence rules (v2.1).** Earlier session work, shipped in this release. Each of the three proposed directions now carries concrete hex codes per material role, dark/light pairing, type pairing with named families, and is forced to be meaningfully different from the other two via material-first thinking (parchment vs leather vs stone vs velvet) and category-diversity rules. Eliminates the v1 drift toward "three flavours of Inter + neutral grey + soft shadow."

- **Phase 2 — three research-backed axes added.** Earlier session work. v1's 9 axes → v2.1's 10 axes: dropped `surface_mix` and `tempo` (derived from other axes), added `trust_stakes` (Cardamone 2025), `category_maturity` (Neumeier Zag), `distinctive_asset` (Byron Sharp). Phase 3 diagnostic prose updated to surface all three new axes for user confirmation.

- **`type_scale:` block in DESIGN.md template.** New optional frontmatter block: base size + modular ratio + named step list (xs / sm / md / lg / xl / 2xl–5xl / display) + hero_max cap. Phase 6.5 picks ratio per surface (dashboard 1.125, marketing 1.25, editorial 1.333).

- **`chart_palette:` block in DESIGN.md template.** New optional frontmatter block: 8 OKLCH-stepped hues per mode for categorical data viz. Present only when generated.

- **Per-surface override blocks in DESIGN.md template.** Optional `dashboard:` and `marketing:` blocks for projects that need meaningfully different palettes per surface. Most projects leave blank — top-level tokens apply to everything.

### Changed

- **`design-direction/SKILL.md` — full reconciliation with references.** Previously contradictory: SKILL.md said "Token frontmatter is read-only here" and ended with a handoff prompt to `init-project` Phase 4 path C; references already encoded token-writing behaviour. Now consistent. Phase list updated 7 → 8 phases (1–7 plus 6.5). "What it produces" expanded from 3 to 5 outputs (added token frontmatter + preview HTML). "Compatibility" block rewrites the token-edit rule to "via Phase 6.5 preview-then-approve, never silent." Phase 7 body rewritten — writes whatever Phase 6.5 approved, no handoff. Hard rule line 181 replaced: "Token frontmatter is written by Phase 6.5 + 7 only after explicit user approval via the HTML preview. Never write tokens silently; never skip the preview when changes are proposed." Sub-agent routing table adds Phase 6.5 row at reasoning tier. Output shape replaces the old regenerate-prompt with a clean wrote-list + `npx @google/design.md lint` next-step.

- **`design-direction/references/phase-7-write-outputs.md`** — deleted the "After writing — the optional handoff" section that asked "Want me to regenerate token frontmatter? hands off to init-project Phase 4 path C". Replaced with "After writing — clean exit" listing what was written (conditional on Phase 6.5 returning approved values) and pointing at the lint sync step. Hard rule line 18 already correctly stated "Token frontmatter is read-only UNLESS Phase 6.5 returned new token values" — preserved unchanged.

- **`init-project/references/phase-4-design-system.md` lines 9–32** — the "Optional handoff to design-direction (deep flow)" block updated. Path B description now mentions "DESIGN.md token frontmatter with an HTML preview for visual approval." When path B returns control, BOTH the BRAND.md step AND the DESIGN.md step in Phase 4 are skipped — `design-direction` owns them. Phase 4 continues from FUNDAMENTALS.md / TOOLING.md / DISCOVERIES.md only.

- **`templates/DESIGN.md`** — added the `type_scale:`, `chart_palette:`, `dashboard:`, `marketing:` blocks listed under Added. Body section grows a "Size scale" subsection in Typography pointing at the new `type_scale:` block with surface-ratio guidance.

- **Plugin manifests** — version bumped 2.0.1 → 2.1.0 in both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Minor bump: behavioural expansion of `design-direction` (now writes tokens + renders preview) plus Phase 2/5 quality upgrades from earlier session work, no breaking changes.

### Compatibility

- **Existing projects on v2.0.x** — drop-in upgrade. The `design-direction` skill on existing initialized projects will detect the existing token shape and offer the alignment diff + preview only when the locked direction actually mismatches current tokens. Projects whose tokens already match the new direction get an "all MATCH — no token changes needed" report (silent re-confirmation, no preview). Pre-v2.1 projects without `type_scale:` or `chart_palette:` blocks get them added only on the next `design-direction` run that approves token changes — additive, never destructive.

- **`agents/preview/` directory** — new folder, only created when Phase 6.5 actually renders a preview. Each direction-level approval writes a new file; iteration writes a new `-v2`, `-v3` file alongside (never overwrites). Recommended to add `agents/preview/` to `.gitignore` — previews are throwaway approval surfaces, not canon. Phase 6.5 does the `.gitignore` add automatically on first preview generation if the line isn't present.

- **`init-project` Phase 4 path B handoff** — backwards-compatible. Projects bootstrapping via the deep flow now skip both BRAND.md and DESIGN.md steps in Phase 4 (previously skipped only BRAND.md and ran path C for DESIGN.md). The path C generator is no longer invoked from the path B handoff — `design-direction` owns DESIGN.md fully. Path A (quick flow) unchanged.

- **CSS-side architecture unchanged.** The `light_mode:` / `dark_mode:` paired blocks, material naming (`paper` / `ash` / `ink` / `hairline`), `oklch(from var(--token) calc(l - 0.08) c h)` derivations, and `npx @google/design.md lint` sync layer are all unchanged. v2.1 just fixes the upstream brain that picks the values feeding into them.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-05-21

Patch release. Correctness fixes across hooks, installer, build script, skill content, and templates. No new features. Skill count 15 → 14 (the `project-protocol` reference-doc skill was removed — see Removed below).

### Fixed
- **`hooks/hooks.json` — WORKLOG.md path now tool-aware.** Cowork sessions write to `cowork/WORKLOG.md`, Claude Code and Codex sessions write to `agents/WORKLOG.md`. Detection via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` / `${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}` env vars. Previously, hooks referenced an unqualified `WORKLOG.md` at cwd root — silently no-op'd on every protocol-conformant project (the three-folder layout never creates a root `WORKLOG.md`). The discipline engine now correctly writes a real-time audit trail on protocol-conformant projects.
- **`hooks/hooks.json` — Stop / PreToolUse / SubagentStart / SubagentStop "cleared state" regex updated.** Previous regex `^# Worklog — cleared` did not match what `save-session` actually writes (`# Worklog — <tier>` on line 1, `> Cleared after each session.` on line 2). Regex now matches both the legacy heading and the current `save-session` output. Result: the Stop hook no longer fires false "unsaved work" warnings immediately after a clean `save-session`.
- **`install.sh` — added `--cowork` flag** (and `INSTALL_FLAVOR=cowork` env var) so Cowork users can install the stripped Cowork zip via the curl one-liner. Default behavior unchanged (FULL build for Claude Code / Codex).
- **`build.sh` — Cowork strip pass now relocates `templates/TOOLING.md`, `templates/STRUCTURE.md`, and `templates/CONTENT.md`** alongside the existing `FUNDAMENTALS.md` / `DESIGN.md` relocation. Previously, those three templates were absent from the Cowork build — Node projects via Cowork failed Phase 4 (`TOOLING.md` not found), and `build-component` / `marketing-brief` had no way to bootstrap their canonical files. Templates now ship into `skills/<consuming-skill>/references/` with paths patched at build time.
- **`build.sh` — STAGE_FULL tmpdir now covered by trap cleanup.** Previously, a `set -e` exit mid-full-build leaked the tmpdir. Both stages (FULL and Cowork) are now cleaned regardless of failure path.
- **`build-component` SKILL.md and phase-5 reference** — three stale "7 steps" references for `design-check` updated to "8 steps". This was missed when `design-check` Step 8 (auto-fix) shipped in v2.0.
- **`build-component` Codex sidecar** — `short_description` trimmed from 223 chars to under 200 to satisfy Cowork's validator cap.
- **`design-check`** — removed the "create component" trigger phrase to eliminate routing collision with `build-component`. Both skills still auto-chain in practice (`build-component` fires first, `design-check` fires post-write), but description-match arbitration is no longer ambiguous.
- **`discipline` SKILL.md** — added a `Triggers — ...` clause to the description for consistency with other gate skills (`audit-before-close`, `verify-by-reading`, `design-check`, `edit-plugin`).
- **`edit-plugin` SKILL.md** — removed a dead reference to a non-existent `commands/*` directory. The plugin has no `commands/` tree; the file set is `skills/`, `hooks/`, `templates/`, `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`.
- **`audit` SKILL.md** — added a `STRUCTURE.md` drift check (declared surfaces vs. actual codebase folders). Surfaces declared in `agents/STRUCTURE.md` that have no corresponding folder, and folders present in the codebase that aren't declared in `STRUCTURE.md`, are reported as drift.
- **`init-project` SKILL.md** — the output-layout block now lists `STRUCTURE.md` alongside the other `agents/`-tier files. Previously, `STRUCTURE.md` was referenced by `build-component` and `audit` but not surfaced in `init-project`'s own layout map.
- **`hooks/session-start-context.md`** — the `STRUCTURE.md` required-read line is now qualified with "(if present — created by `build-component` on first invocation)" so the SessionStart context injection does not imply the file is mandatory on every project.
- **`templates/TOOLING.md`** — added a one-line note that the author's `~/Arel OS/Projects/` example is illustrative; other users adapt the path prefix to their own project layout.
- **`templates/STRUCTURE.md` and `templates/CONTENT.md`** — previously dead templates (no skill cp'd from them). `build-component`'s phase-1-structure-detection now cps `STRUCTURE.md` → `agents/STRUCTURE.md` as the initial template, and `marketing-brief`'s phase-2-content-registry cps `CONTENT.md` → `agents/marketing/CONTENT.md`. Both templates now serve their intended bootstrap role.

### Removed
- **`project-protocol` skill** — pure reference doc that duplicated `README.md` and the `init-project` SKILL.md. Its triggers (`project start`, `init project`, `session start`, `read protocol`) caused routing ambiguity with `init-project` and `session-recap`. Any unique content was merged into `README.md` and `init-project` before deletion. Skill count 15 → 14.

### Changed
- **`README.md`** — skill count updated 15 → 14. "Session lifecycle (the core 5)" heading updated to "(the core 4)" with the `project-protocol` bullet removed.
- **Plugin manifests** — version bumped 2.0.0 → 2.0.1 in both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Patch bump: correctness fixes only, no new features. Both manifest descriptions updated to reference 14 skills and to drop `project-protocol` from the listed skills.

### Compatibility
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.0.0. No file-format changes, no template-shape changes, no breaking changes to consumer projects. Existing projects pick up the corrected hook behaviour on next session start and the corrected Cowork build on next install.
- Removal of the `project-protocol` skill is invisible to consumer projects (the skill was a reference doc, never wrote files). Users who relied on `/project-protocol` as a slash invocation should use `init-project` or `session-recap` instead, depending on intent.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- **`build-component` skill** — 14th skill. Per-component build skill with a 5-phase flow: (1) structure detection — reads `agents/STRUCTURE.md` or runs first-run detection to create it (surfaces present, component locations per tier, stack per surface, conventions detected); (2) intake & tier — silently infers Generic / Marketing / App tier from the request, surface-aware so dashboard-only projects never see the Marketing tier in prompts; (3) reuse scan — greps existing components for reusable primitives, proposes one of three strategies (compose existing primitives, extend an existing component, build a new primitive); (4) data shape & location — locks the component's props contract and the exact file path under the tier's folder; (5) preview & write — shows the diff before writing, then fires `design-check` automatically after. Detects existing project convention silently (cva + forwardRef + cn triplet or the project's own pattern — never imposes shadcn on a non-shadcn codebase). Supports adopt-external sub-mode (paste an Aceternity / Magic UI / 21st.dev snippet, normalize to project tokens and naming) and recreate-from-inspiration sub-mode (for installable libraries like shadcn — installs the canonical version rather than recreating it from a screenshot). Cross-tier import enforcement: Marketing components cannot import App components and vice-versa; both can freely import Generic primitives. Ships with Codex sidecar.
- **`marketing-brief` skill** — 15th skill. One-time deep marketing-site brief that runs ONCE, near the end of a project after features ship — not during early product work. Builds `agents/marketing/CONTENT.md` as the single source of truth for marketing content (FEATURES, AUDIENCES, COMPARISONS, TESTIMONIALS, FAQS, LEGAL_PAGES tables). Every marketing page reads from this registry — nav, footer, per-feature pages, comparison pages, FAQ sections, legal nav — so content updates happen in one place. Then proposes a sitemap (`agents/marketing/SITEMAP.md`), writes per-page briefs to `agents/marketing/briefs/`, per-page copy to `agents/marketing/copy/`, a media manifest to `agents/marketing/MEDIA.md` with a fictional-customer brand name asked once at the start and used throughout (the dub.co "acme" pattern), and per-page layout sketches to `agents/marketing/layouts/`. Auto-skips on dashboard-only / internal-tool projects (no marketing surface detected in `agents/STRUCTURE.md`). Never overwrites existing canon — offers a 3-way merge (replace / merge / append) for any conflict.
- **`templates/STRUCTURE.md`** — new template. Per-project structural map auto-generated by `build-component` on first run. Captures surfaces present (Marketing, Web app, Desktop app, Docs, Mobile), component locations per tier (Generic / Marketing / App-web / App-desktop), stack per surface, conventions detected (style system, file naming, folder structure, token chain, icon library), and cross-tier import rules enforced by `audit`. Edited by hand only when project structure changes (folder rename, new app added).
- **`templates/CONTENT.md`** — new template for the marketing content registry. Defines the canonical shape of the FEATURES / AUDIENCES / COMPARISONS / TESTIMONIALS / FAQS / LEGAL_PAGES tables that `marketing-brief` writes and every marketing page reads from. Includes per-table editing rules (immutable ids and slugs, audiences must exist before reference, verbatim testimonial quotes).
- **`init-project` modernize mode** — new Phase 0c. Fifth mode alongside `audit | migration | empty | fresh`. For already-initiated projects on v1.x, runs an interactive upgrade pass: per-canon-file confirmation loop (the user sees a diff against the current global template and approves or skips, file by file), silent global-standard updates to `FUNDAMENTALS.md` and `TOOLING.md` (same silent-overwrite rule as `init-project` Phase 4), a codebase design-system sweep via the upgraded `design-check` Step 8, `STRUCTURE.md` reconciliation (existing folder structure detected and written back), waste archival (any deprecated file is moved to `archive/<date>-modernize/` — never deleted silently), and an optional design-direction handoff for projects whose brand needs a rebuild. Triggered by user invoking with intent to upgrade, or by audit-mode detecting significant drift from the current global standard.

### Changed
- **`design-check` Step 8 (auto-fix)** — Step 8 now splits findings into two buckets. Auto-fixable (mechanical, low-risk): raw hex matching a defined token (`#0a0a0a` → `bg-background`), missing image dimensions, `<div onClick>` → `<button>`, three-period `...` → ellipsis `…`, unit non-breaking-space (`10 MB` → `10&nbsp;MB`), `outline: none` → `:focus-visible` rule. Human-judgment (still surfaced for user input only): cardinal sins (indigo accent, two-stop trust gradient, emoji-as-icon, hardcoded display font, AI-dashboard tile, invented metric, filler copy), banned words, raw hex with no matching token, missing meaningful alt text. Auto-fixes apply only on a single user batch confirmation — never per-file silent edits. **Safety rule:** never auto-fix when the target token isn't defined in `agents/DESIGN.md` (would silently create a broken reference). Batched per file for large codebases (one diff per file, user can accept all / skip file / accept individual). `allowed-tools` expanded to include `Edit, Write`.
- **`init-project` Phase 0 (mode detection)** — fifth mode `modernize` added alongside `audit | migration | empty | fresh`. Triggered by user invoking with intent to upgrade, or by audit-mode detecting significant drift from the current global standard (templates ahead of the in-project copies).
- **README skill count** — 13 → 15.
- **Plugin manifests** — version bumped 1.5.0 → 2.0.0 in both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Major bump: behavioural expansion of `design-check` (now writes) and `init-project` (now modernizes already-initiated projects), two new skills (`build-component`, `marketing-brief`) closing the per-component-build and marketing-content gaps, mature end-to-end lifecycle coverage from bootstrap through ship through marketing handoff.

### Compatibility
- **Existing projects on v1.5.x** — fully compatible. `build-component` runs first-run detection inline and creates `agents/STRUCTURE.md` on first invocation; existing folder structure is detected, never imposed. `marketing-brief` auto-skips on dashboard-only / internal-tool projects (no marketing surface detected). `design-check` upgrade is additive — Step 8 auto-fix is opt-in (user must approve the fix batch, never applied silently). `init-project` modernize mode is opt-in (explicit invoke or user opt-in from the audit drift report).
- **`design-check` Edit capability** — the skill now has `Write`, `Edit` in its `allowed-tools` to apply auto-fixes. Cowork build still strips the `allowed-tools` line at package time, so no breaking change for any consumer.
- **`STRUCTURE.md`** — new file in `agents/`. Projects without one get it created on first `build-component` invocation; nothing else is affected (the audit / design-check / save-session flows tolerate its absence).
- **`agents/marketing/`** — new folder, only created when `marketing-brief` runs. Projects that never invoke `marketing-brief` never see it.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- **`design-direction` skill** — 13th skill. Deep brand-direction diagnostic that sits one layer upstream of `init-project` Phase 4. Takes a single free-text brand dump (product, audience, problem, surfaces, monetisation, what-it-should-not-look-like) and silently extracts 9 taste axes — trust temperature, use frequency, information density, cultural anchor, brand archetype, reference tribe (look-like + look-unlike), surface mix, tempo, brand-specific refusal list. Returns a plain-English diagnostic for one-pass confirmation, proposes a 3–5 site reference moodboard, then offers 3 *meaningfully different* named design directions (e.g. "Editorial Cream", "Color Lab", "Warm Modern Indian") each with palette intent in words, type pairing, reference URL, and a "why this fits" line tied back to the diagnostic. After the user picks (hybrids allowed), writes a rich `agents/BRAND.md`, fills the `agents/DESIGN.md` Overview, and adds brand-specific anti-patterns to the DO NOT block — universal anti-patterns above are never edited, token frontmatter is never touched. Ends with an optional handoff to `init-project` Phase 4 path C to regenerate tokens against the locked direction. Works standalone on already-initiated projects to re-anchor brand. Ships with Codex sidecar; 7-phase skill structure with each phase in `references/` for progressive disclosure.
- **`templates/FUNDAMENTALS.md` — small Vercel-derived craft items.** Appended under existing sections: loading-state timing (150–300ms show-delay + 300–500ms minimum visible window to avoid flicker), stable skeletons (must mirror final layout exactly), loading buttons preserve label (`Save…` with spinner, never replaced by just a spinner), tooltip timing (first delayed, peers no-delay), ellipsis character (`…` not `...`), curly quotes, non-breaking spaces for glued terms (`10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘&nbsp;+&nbsp;K`, `Next.js&nbsp;16`), `scroll-margin-top` on anchored headings, `color-scheme` on `<html>`, `theme-color` meta for mobile address-bar / OS-task-switcher polish.

### Changed
- **`init-project` Phase 4 reference** — new "Optional handoff to `design-direction`" sub-section added before the existing BRAND.md A/B/C flow. Phase 4 now offers two paths: A (quick — existing 3-question BRAND.md flow), B (deep — hand off to `design-direction`). Default remains A. If the deep skill is unavailable on disk, silently falls through to A. When B is chosen, `design-direction` populates BRAND.md and DESIGN.md Overview + brand-specific DO NOT additions; Phase 4 then runs as path C with the much richer brief.
- **`README.md`** — skill count updated from 12 to 13; `design-direction` listed under Discipline skills.

### Compatibility
- **Existing projects on v1.4.x** — no breaking change. `design-direction` can be invoked standalone (`/design-direction` or trigger phrase like "re-anchor brand") against an already-initiated project. It reads existing `agents/BRAND.md` / `agents/STATUS.md` first and only asks for missing pieces. Existing populated sections are never silently overwritten — shown to user with a 3-way merge offer (replace / merge / append). DESIGN.md universal anti-patterns block is never touched; only the bottom brand-specific placeholder is filled. Token frontmatter is read-only in this skill — projects keep their existing tokens unless the user explicitly accepts the optional handoff to Phase 4 path C at the end.
- **Existing `FUNDAMENTALS.md` files** in initiated projects get the small Vercel-derived additions on next `init-project` run (silent overwrite — same global-standard rule as before).
- **Phase 4 handoff** — old `init-project` SKILL flow still works exactly as before for path A. Path B is opt-in via the new question.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- **`edit-plugin` skill** — 12th skill. Self-discipline gate for any change to this plugin's own source (skills, hooks, manifests, templates, README, build scripts). 7-step protocol that chains `git add` → `commit` → `push` to every edit so the plugin source repo on disk stays in lockstep with `origin/main` on GitHub. Fixes the gap where an agent edited a skill, the user thanked them, and the change was never pushed — so the next pull / reinstall would lose it. Same gate-skill shape as `discipline` and `audit-before-close`; ships with a Codex sidecar.

### Changed
- **`save-session` skill** — added Step 10 "Git sync (commit, push, auto-merge into `main`)". After the WORKLOG → CHANGELOG/STATUS/BRIEF cascade, save-session now stages protocol .md changes, commits with a structured message, pushes the current branch to GitHub, and auto-merges into `main` via the worktree path resolved from `git worktree list`. Asks before staging anything outside `cowork/`, `agents/`, `human/`. Stops cleanly on detached HEAD / push failure / merge conflict with an exact recovery command. `allowed-tools` expanded to include `git:*`. Step 11 (Confirm) now reports the git outcome.
- **`README.md`** — skill count updated from 11 to 12; `edit-plugin` listed under Discipline skills.

### Compatibility
- Existing projects on v1.3.x: `save-session` works without configuration as long as the project's working directory is a git repo with a remote. Repos with no remote skip the push step and still merge locally.
- `edit-plugin` fires only for edits to this plugin's source repo — has no effect on consumer projects.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-19

### Added
- **`design-check` skill** — UI-work gate (new, 11th skill). Fires on any visual change (creating/editing components, styles, pages). Walks the agent through a 7-step sequence: read `DESIGN.md` + `FUNDAMENTALS.md`, search existing components for reuse, identify tokens needed, **halt on missing tokens** (propose addition, wait for user confirmation), write code using approved tokens only, scan diff for raw hex / px / font / `outline: none` / `<div onClick>` / images without alt-width-height, halt on violations. Same gate-skill shape as `discipline` and `audit-before-close`; ships with a Codex sidecar.
- **`templates/DESIGN.md` (new shaped template)** — Phase 4 now fills a complete scaffold instead of generating the shape from scratch. Token categories, accent-discipline rule (≤ 2 visible uses of `--primary` per screen), DO NOT section with universal anti-patterns, Extension protocol (need a missing value? stop, propose, wait, then add), and an Agent prompt guide are all baked in. The scaffold also formalises OKLCH-based derivation for hover/disabled tints so adding a "fourth color" isn't a new hex code, it's `oklch(from var(--primary) ...)`.

### Changed
- **`templates/FUNDAMENTALS.md` significantly tightened.** Existing 6 Levels / Ratio Rule / Motion Principles / Token Rule kept verbatim. Added: the **7 cardinal sins** (indigo hex, two-stop trust gradients, emoji-as-icons, hardcoded display fonts, AI-dashboard-tile shape, invented metrics, filler copy), the **5 required states** table (loading / empty / error / populated / edge) with loading-duration thresholds and error/empty composition rules, a **craft-details** section (focus / forms / images / touch / semantic HTML / URL state / performance), a **banned-words** list (hype / filler / corporate zombie / AI-slop openers), **icon discipline** (one library, `currentColor`, 3:1 contrast, semantic alt), **copy rules**, and a **pre-ship checklist** that `audit-before-close` runs. Type 2 of the Token Rule ("missing token") now reads **STOP and propose to the user; do not improvise** — the language change converts the rule from agent judgment into a halt-and-confirm enforced by `design-check`.
- **`init-project` Phase 4 reference** — DESIGN.md generation refactored. The skill no longer invents the shape per project; it reads `templates/DESIGN.md` and fills the placeholders (A: transfer existing, B: transfer + add, C: fresh). Hard rules: never delete the template's sections, never edit the DO NOT universals (only add brand-specific items), never edit the Extension protocol wording (it's enforced by `design-check`).
- **`audit` skill** — added a design-system scan step (UI projects only). Greps component files for raw hex / px / `font-family` strings, cardinal-sin patterns, accessibility floor violations (`outline: none` without `:focus-visible`, `<img>` missing alt/width/height, `<div onClick>`), and banned-words in shipped copy. Findings reported as category (A) — real violations.
- **`README.md`** — skill count updated from 10 to 11; `design-check` listed under Discipline skills; `audit` description notes the new design-system scan.

### Compatibility
- Existing projects on v1.2.x get the richer `FUNDAMENTALS.md` written on next `init-project` run (silent overwrite — global standard, same rule as before). DESIGN.md handling: if the project's existing DESIGN.md has the new format already (YAML frontmatter), Phase 4 fills gaps only; if it has the legacy format, Phase 4 re-shapes it into the template. No silent destruction of existing content.
- `design-check` fires on description match in any project that has both `agents/DESIGN.md` and `agents/FUNDAMENTALS.md` present. Projects without those files: the skill stops at step 1 and tells the user to run `init-project` first.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Global Node tooling standard** — new `templates/TOOLING.md` template, locked 2026-05-15. Covers bun as the only package manager, Node 24 LTS via Homebrew, required project files (`.nvmrc`, `.npmrc`, `package.json` fields), and the Next.js / Turbopack defaults for Next 16. Same global-standard pattern as `FUNDAMENTALS.md` — overwritten verbatim from the plugin template on every `init-project` run.
- **`init-project` Phase 4 — `agents/TOOLING.md` step** — copies the new template into `agents/TOOLING.md` **only for Node projects** (detected by a `package.json` at the project root). Swift / Python / non-Node projects skip silently. If the project's actual `package.json` / `.nvmrc` / `.npmrc` drift from the standard, the mismatch surfaces as a `[VERIFY]` item at Phase 7 — never auto-fixed.

### Changed
- **`init-project` SKILL.md Hard rules** — `agents/TOOLING.md` added as a second explicit silent-overwrite exception alongside `agents/FUNDAMENTALS.md`. Both are global locked standards, neither is per-project.
- **Phase 3 root `CLAUDE.md` template** — non-negotiable rules gain rule #7: "If Node project: read `agents/TOOLING.md` before any package, install, or dev-server work. Use `bun` only — never `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`." Gives the standard teeth at session start for Node projects without polluting Swift/Python ones.
- **Phase 3 root `README.md` template** — `agents/TOOLING.md` entry added to the agents/ catalog with the "Node only · never edited per project" cascade note.
- **Plugin README.md** — project-layout block now shows `TOOLING.md (Node only)` in the agents/ tier so installers see the addition before installing.

### Compatibility
- Existing Node projects on the v1.1.x layout get `agents/TOOLING.md` written on next `init-project` run (silent overwrite — global standard).
- Non-Node projects are unaffected: no new file is created and the root `CLAUDE.md` Node-only rule is a no-op for them.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- **`init-project` Phase 0 (mode detection)** — runs first on every invocation and classifies the project as one of `audit | migration | empty | fresh`. Replaces the old inline audit-mode check inside Phase 1. See `skills/init-project/references/phase-0-mode-detection.md`.
- **`init-project` Phase 0a (empty bootstrap)** — when the project has no markdown anywhere, ask the user a short set of questions (project name, one sentence, target user, tech stack, stage, locked decisions, first direction) and use the answers to populate templates with real content instead of `[Project Name]` placeholders. See `skills/init-project/references/phase-0a-empty-bootstrap.md`.
- **`init-project` Phase 0b (old-version migration)** — when the project is on the older flat-root layout (root `CLAUDE.md` + protocol files at root, no `cowork/` / `agents/` / `human/` folders), migrate every old-layout file into the three-folder layout. Clean moves are mechanical (no user questions); ambiguous files (`STATUS.md`, `BRIEF.md`, `WORKLOG.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) get a Haiku sub-agent classification. Root `CLAUDE.md` is split via sub-agent into root rules + `cowork/CLAUDE.md` + `agents/BRIEF.md`. All user content is preserved; new-version files are layered in only where missing. See `skills/init-project/references/phase-0b-migration.md`.

### Changed
- **Phase 2 (non-protocol merge)** now offers six routing options instead of four: **Cowork** (move into `cowork/`), **Agent docs** (move into `agents/docs/` or `agents/docs/detail/` and auto-register in `agents/docs/INDEX.md` + root `CLAUDE.md` `## Extended Context` — same pattern as the `add-context` skill), Merge, Reference, Leave, Skip. Closes the gap where extra markdown files (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `NOTES.md`, team conventions, internal docs) had no clean tier-aware destination.
- **Phase 1 (discovery)** — layout detection moved upstream to Phase 0. Phase 1 still buckets every `.md` file but the mode + audit flag are passed in from Phase 0.
- **Phase 7 (final summary)** — output now varies by mode. Migration mode reports clean moves + sub-agent classifications + root `CLAUDE.md` split destinations + which new-version files were layered in. Empty mode reports the bootstrap answer object and surfaces `[VERIFY]` items. Audit mode lists filled-vs-untouched files and runs the `audit` skill's drift report.
- **`init-project` SKILL.md** — phase list expanded from 7 to 10 logical phases (0, 0a, 0b, 1–7). The mode-detection section replaces the old "Audit-mode detection" inline block.

### Build
- **`build.sh` now produces two zips per release.** Restoring the dual-zip shape that v1.0.2 dist had but the v1.0.2 build script had collapsed into one:
  - `project-protocol-vX.Y.Z.zip` — FULL build for Claude Code + Codex. Includes `hooks/`, `templates/`, `.codex-plugin/`, every `skills/<name>/agents/openai.yaml` Codex sidecar, and the `allowed-tools:` SKILL.md frontmatter line.
  - `project-protocol-vX.Y.Z-cowork.zip` — STRIPPED build for Cowork. Only `.claude-plugin/` + `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (with `allowed-tools:` stripped) + `references/` / `examples/`. `FUNDAMENTALS.md` relocated into `skills/init-project/references/` and SKILL.md path reference patched at build time.

### Compatibility
- Existing projects on the v1.0.x three-folder layout are unaffected — they get classified as `audit` mode and the flow is the same as before.
- Old flat-root projects can now be migrated automatically via `init-project` instead of needing manual file moves.
- Empty repos can now be initialised meaningfully without writing placeholder-heavy templates the user has to clean up after.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **Cowork install:** `build.sh` now produces a Cowork-spec-compliant zip — the same zip also installs in Claude Code and Codex. Previously Cowork rejected the zip with "Plugin validation failed" because the build shipped components outside Anthropic's documented plugin spec.

### Changed
- Build artifact is stripped at build time to the Cowork plugin shape:
  - Kept: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (+ `references/`, `examples/` sub-folders).
  - Stripped: `.codex-plugin/`, `hooks/`, `templates/`, `skills/<name>/agents/openai.yaml` (Codex sidecars), and the `allowed-tools:` SKILL.md frontmatter line.
  - `templates/FUNDAMENTALS.md` is relocated into `skills/init-project/references/` and the init-project SKILL.md path reference is patched at build time.
- Source repo still contains `.codex-plugin/`, `hooks/`, `templates/`, and `agents/openai.yaml` sidecars — they're just excluded from the shipped artifact. Re-enable them later if/when Cowork's validator loosens.
- Removed `keywords` field from both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Cowork's validator accepts only the four fields documented in Anthropic's plugin manifest schema (`name`, `version`, `description`, `author`).
- Shortened every SKILL.md frontmatter `description` for cleaner triggering. Previous: 287–589 chars. New: 160–198 chars. (The 200-char cap I had been "fixing for" turned out to be wrong — Anthropic's `create-cowork-plugin` SKILL ships a 340-char description and works — but shorter is still better.)
- `init-project` description retains the "or when a project has no root CLAUDE.md" auto-trigger hint.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-11

### Changed
- Updated plugin.json descriptions in both manifests to describe the three-folder layout (cowork/agents/human) + 10 skills + 8 hooks, replacing the stale legacy flat-layout file list.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-11

Initial public release. Clean v1.0.0 baseline.

### Skills (10)

**Session lifecycle:**
- `init-project` — bootstrap or audit a project with the standard three-folder layout.
- `save-session` — close a session: WORKLOG → CHANGELOG, update STATUS, clear WORKLOG (tier-aware).
- `session-recap` — mid-session snapshot of what's been done and what's still open.
- `add-context` — add extended context files (data contracts, domain reference, integrations).
- `project-protocol` — reference document defining the file set + session discipline.

**Discipline (new):**
- `discipline` — pre-action gate: pause, declare, cascade, verify, confirm.
- `verify-by-reading` — read-before-answer enforcement.
- `audit-before-close` — spec-vs-implementation check before marking work done.
- `discussion-mode` — read-only conversation mode when user signals thinking.
- `audit` — cross-file consistency check across canon.

### Hooks (8)

- `SessionStart` — inject required reading.
- `UserPromptSubmit` — pre-task classification reminder.
- `PreToolUse` (Edit|Write filter) — WORKLOG-cleared warning.
- `PreCompact` — back up WORKLOG before context compaction.
- `PostCompact` — re-orient context after compaction.
- `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` — log sub-agent invocations to WORKLOG.
- `Stop` — warn if WORKLOG has unsaved lines.

### Project layout

`init-project` creates a three-folder structure in target projects:

- Root `CLAUDE.md` (rules + folder map) + root `README.md` (file-and-dependency map).
- `cowork/` — orchestration tier (Cowork's files).
- `agents/` — project canon tier (Codex / Claude Code read here).
- `human/` — human-facing tier (daily steering file at `agenda.md`).

### Compatibility

- Skills follow [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) core spec — portable across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and other tools that adopt the standard.
- Every skill ships with a Codex `agents/openai.yaml` sidecar for polished Codex UX.
- Dual manifest: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.
- Worktree detection in `session-recap` covers both Codex and Claude Code worktree paths.
